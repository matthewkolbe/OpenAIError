### Automatic Exception Handling with OpenAI's API

To quote ChatGPT itself: "Code Injection Risk: Automatically writing code to files based on an AI's recommendation is risky and might lead to security vulnerabilities."

This library is purely for educational purposes, and should be treated as potentially dangerous. The purpose is to automatically gather debuging information, pass it on to an OpenAI GPT, and use its response to generate a new module to fix the issue that the GPT identified. While this technology fascinates and intrigues me, IT IS NONDETERMINISTIC, could potentially delete valuable intellectual property, could facilitate the singularity or worse.

Use YOUR OWN OpenAI API account to automatically diagnose exceptions and replace broken code (with a code injection).
